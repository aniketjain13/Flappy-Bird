# Flappy Bird

**Game Description**
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird, which moves persistently to the right.
The player is tasked with navigating the bird through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights.
Bird automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the screen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point.
Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the game.
